# Typwrtr

## Overview

Typwrtr is a local-first voice dictation **product** (macOS first): hotkey → speak → cleaned text in the focused field. ASR and text cleanup come from **euhadra**; this repo owns the native shell and product UX.

Canonical decisions: @docs/product.md. UX/interaction: @docs/ux-decisions.md. Use-case backlog: @docs/use-cases.md. Engine details: euhadra `docs/spec.md` / crates.io `euhadra`.


## Project Structure

```
docs/                 # Product decisions, use cases, handoff, i18n policy
git-hooks/            # Optional pre-push format / lint hooks
AGENTS.md             # This file (CLAUDE.md → symlink)
# Forthcoming:
#   crates/ or core/  # Rust + UniFFI
#   apps/macos/       # Swift menu-bar shell
```

No application source tree yet — product definition phase.

## Development Setup

```bash
# Pre-push hook (format / lint / clippy) when Rust/Swift lands:
#   git config core.hooksPath git-hooks
#
# Expected later: Rust stable, Xcode (macOS shell), UniFFI toolchain,
# and crates.io dependency on euhadra (published; pin a version in Cargo.toml).
```

## Build & Test

```bash
# Placeholder until crates exist. Prefer workspace-wide commands when added:
#   cargo build --workspace
#   cargo test  --workspace
```

Until then, documentation-only changes need no build step.

## Development Principles

- Product decisions in @docs/product.md and @docs/ux-decisions.md are SSOT; update those files when changing licensing, pricing, shell, or interaction behaviour.

- Prefer measuring latency and recognition quality over conjecturing (see Common Rules → Measure, Don't Conjecture).
- Do not require end users to build from source for the happy path.

## Architectural Boundaries

- **euhadra**: listening accuracy (ASR, filters, processors). Typwrtr must not reimplement that pipeline ad hoc.
- **Typwrtr shell**: hotkeys, permissions, Accessibility, insertion, onboarding, distribution.
- **MVP shell**: Swift + UniFFI on macOS. Windows later via WinUI + same UniFFI API surface.
- No in-app license server, accounts, or device binding (see @docs/product.md §4).

## Prohibitions

1. Do not add cloud accounts or license checks as requirements for basic dictation.
2. Do not put product-definition SSOT only in chat; update @docs/product.md / @docs/ux-decisions.md / @docs/use-cases.md.

3. Do not expand MVP to terminal command execution (U7) or heavy structured-note flows (U8) without an explicit decision in @docs/use-cases.md.

## Git Conventions

- Conventional Commits as in Common Rules. Suggested scopes: `docs:`, `macos:`, `core:`, `uniffi:`.
- Branch prefix: `cursor/<topic>`, `claude/<topic>`, or `human/<topic>`.

## Session Handoff

Long-running workstreams use GitHub issues for cross-session continuity. See `docs/handoff-protocol.md` for the full protocol.

- Label: `session-handoff`
- One issue per workstream (not per session)
- On session start, read the relevant handoff issue and confirm the **Next action** with the user before executing.

## Internationalisation

If this project ships a Japanese-facing entry point, follow `docs/i18n-policy.md`:

- Translations are suffix files (`README.ja.md` next to `README.md`); no language directories.
- Only `README.md` and the user-facing introduction tier of `docs/` are in scope. Engineering docs and ADRs stay English-only.
- Each translated file carries a `> Source: <name>.md @ <sha>` header. PRs are never blocked on translation parity.

## Common Development Rules

### TDD (Red → Green → Refactor)

All implementation work proceeds in this cycle:

1. **Red**: write a failing test that captures the intended behaviour.
2. **Green**: write the minimum code that makes the test pass.
3. **Refactor**: tidy up while keeping tests green.

When a test fails, fix the production code — do not delete, skip, or weaken the test.

### Measure, Don't Conjecture

Base decisions on observed data, not assumptions. Before optimising, claiming a bottleneck, or asserting that something is slow or broken, measure it — profile, benchmark, log, or reproduce. When you report a cause, cite the measurement that supports it.

### Git Conventions

- **Conventional Commits**: `feat:` `fix:` `docs:` `refactor:` `test:` `ci:` `chore:`. Project-specific prefixes (e.g. `data:`, `experiments:`) live in the project's `AGENTS.md`.
- **Branch naming**: use a short prefix for the agent or author followed by a topic, e.g. `claude/<topic>`, `codex/<topic>`, or `human/<topic>`.
- **Trailer**: when an AI agent authors the commit, append a trailer crediting the agent. Do not embed model name or session info in the trailer; put those in the commit body if needed.
- **Pre-push hook**: install via `cp git-hooks/pre-push .git/hooks/pre-push && chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-push` (or `git config core.hooksPath git-hooks`). The hook runs format / lint / clippy before every push. Tests are intentionally omitted — TDD keeps them green at commit time.

### Pull Requests

- **Always ready for review.** Open PRs in the "ready" state, never as drafts. Draft PRs do not fire review-requested events and slow the loop.
- **Auto-subscribe after creating a PR.** Immediately after the PR is created, subscribe to its activity without asking the user. Rationale: the user explicitly opted into the "agent opens and watches its own PRs" workflow at the template level, so the per-PR confirmation is noise. Unsubscribe only when the user says to stop, when the PR merges, or when it is closed unmerged.
- **One PR per workstream**, matching the handoff issue. Reference the issue with `Closes #N` per `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.

### Stream Idle Timeout Mitigation

Cloud agent sessions occasionally fail with `Stream idle timeout - partial response received` on long output. To reduce risk:

1. **Stage long writes.** For long documents or source files, write the skeleton (headings, function signatures, trait stubs) first, then fill each section in follow-up edits. Avoid single blocks larger than ~200 lines.
2. **Watch out after large reads.** Reading a big file (e.g. `Cargo.lock`, large generated modules) and then immediately producing long output is a common trigger. Split into separate turns or excerpt only the relevant portion.
3. **Recover carefully.** A timeout can still leave the file write completed. Run `git status` before retrying so the same content is not written twice.

### Common Prohibitions

1. Do not delete, skip, or comment out existing tests.
2. Do not modify CI configuration without explicit instruction.
3. Do not weaken production code merely to make tests pass.
4. Do not commit credentials, API keys, signed URLs, or anything in `.env*`.
